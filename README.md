   well documented (ahm, mostly well documented that is ;) ) and easy 
   to adapt to different needs

   make creating an online photo album from a collection of images
   extremely easy

How to start from here:
-----------------------

First, you may want to look at an example to see what it looks like:

http://www.eckhartarnold.de/apppages/GWTPhotoAlbum/BayreuthAndAbroad

If you want to create your own album, run the program "GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py" 
from the "scripts" subdirectory which leads you through the creation of a 
photo album in a similar manner as the well known "assistants" of popular 
office suites.

IMPORTANT: Before you can run "GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py" the following 
software must be installed on your system first:

Python 2.6 or higher (www.python.org)
The python imaging library PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
The pyexiv2 library (http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/)


How to use the sources:
-----------------------

If you want to use GWTPhotoAlbum in your own AJAX projects, you can browse
the source code in the "src/de.eckhartarnold.client" directory. Please
read "INSTALL.txt" for for information on how to compile and use GWTPhotoAlbum.
Further documentation can be found in the documentation directory. The 
javadocs of the AJAX part of GWTPhotoAlbum can be found in the sub-directory
