For Python 2.4/2.5 compatibility this directory contains a file "zipfile.py" 
and a sub-directory names "json". The "zipfile.py" and the files in the 
sub-directory "json" are modules from the Python 2.6 distribution which
are included here so that the scripts also run with older Python 
versions, i.e. Python 2.4 and above. The files "decoder.py" and
"encoder.py" have been backported for compatibility with Python 2.4/2.5.
