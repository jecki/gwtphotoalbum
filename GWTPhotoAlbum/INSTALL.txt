Installing GWTPhotoAlbum from GWTPhotoAlbum-fat-sources-VERSION.tgz
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Requirements and Dependencies:


A.1: AJAX part of GWTPhotoAlbum

The AJAX part of GWTPhotoAlbum is realized with the google web 
toolkit. There is a  pre-compiled version of the AJAX part of 
GWTPhotoAlbum in the "scripts/GWTPhotoAlbum-Deploy.zip" file. 

If you want to compile the AJAX part of GWTPhotoAlbum yourself, 
you need to install the google web toolkit first:

1. google web toolkit version 2.4 or higher:
   https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/
   
   (This may require the installation of further
    software like a java virtual machine, an internet
    browser and the Apache ant build tool.)
   
   
A.2: GWTPhotoAlbum creator python script
   
In order to run the GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py program to generate
web galleries you additionally need the following software:

(GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py can be run without compiling the AJAX
part first as it already contains the compiled AJAX scripts.)
   
2. The Python programming language version 2.6 or higher:
   www.python.org
   
3. The python imaging library version 1.1.7 or higher:
   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
   
4. The pyexiv2 library version 1.3 or higher (probably 1.3 works best):
   http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/


A.3: C++ version of an album creator programm and plugins for external
     photo management software

The development of a C++ replacement of GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py as well
as plugings for common photo management software is under way. The C++
part is realized with the Qt toolkit. The sources for the C++ replacement 
and plugins can be found under the  ubdirectory "albumcreator".

1. Qt toolkit version 4.6 or higher:
   https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/
   
2. Furthermore, the boost::crc library is needed: 
   http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/libs/crc/

3. For the kipi-plugin also the KDE libraries and headers are needed. Find 
   out more on:
   http://www.kde.org
   
   On Linux systems it is the easiest to just install the KDE and kipi 
   development libraries with the standard package manager of your 
   linux distribution.




B. Installing and running GWTPhotoAlbum:


1. Download the latest fat source package: 
   
   GWTPhotoAlbum-fat-sources-VERSION.tgz
   
   from the project website: 
   
   http://code.google.com/p/gwtphotoalbum/
   
   or check out the subversion repository from there!


2. Create a new google web toolkit project by entering the command
   on the shell:

   webAppCreator -out GWTPhotoAlbum de.eckhartarnold.client.GWTPhotoAlbum


3. Extract the GWTPhotoAlbum sources with the command:
   
   tar --overwrite -xzvf GWTPhotoAlbum-fat-sources-VERSION.tar.gz
   
   
4. Change to the GWTPhotoAlbum directory with:

   cd GWTPhotoAlbum
   
 
5. In file "build.xml" find and edit the line 

   <property name="gwt.sdk" location="/opt/gwt" />
   	
   so that location points to the location where you have installed gwt.
   	
   
6. View the demo gallery with the command:

   ant devmode
   
   
7. In order to generate the javadoc Documentation run:

   ant -f javadoc.xml   
   
   



C. Installing the kipi-plugin:


1. Download the latest kipi-plugin source package:
   kipiplugin_webslideshow-VERSION.tgz

   from the project website
   
   http://code.google.com/p/gwtphotoalbum/
   
   or check out the subversion repository from there!
   
      
2. Run qmake:
   
   qmake kipi-plugin.pro

 
3. Run make:

   make 
   
   Optionally, you can also run "make debug" instead.
   
   
4. Change to the albumcreator/kipiplugin_wbslideshow directory and run:

   sudo make install




D. Creating a web slide show:

There are different alternatives for creating a web slide show. In either
of the cases described in the following the photo album will be created
on your local hard-disk. As of now, you will still have to upload it 
manually (e.g. via FTP) to a server to have a web slide show in the internet.


Alternative 1: Use the "GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py" script.

1. Change to the "scripts" sub-directory of the "GWTPhotoAlbum" main 
   directory tree and enter the command from the shell:

   python GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py
   
2. Follow the dialog which allows you to add and sort images, add captions,
   make some customizations and, finally, create the web slide show on
   your local hard disk.

or

Alternative 2: Use the "quickalbum" executable. (Much faster then the
   "GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py script! But it does not support adding 
   caption string.)

1. Change to the "albumcreator" directory. Run "qmake" and then "make".

2. Change to the "albumcreator/quickalbum" subdirectory. Run "quickalbum": 
   A Dialog Box pops up that leads you through the process of creating an
   album.

or

Alternative 3: Use the "kipi-plugin"

1. Compile and install the kipi-plugin as described above in section
   "C. Installing the kipi-plugin".
   
2. Run any programm that makes use of kipi-plugins like KDE's "Digikam"
   to create a web slide show on your local hard disk.
   
3. Upload the web slide show to a server with any FTP client (e.g. gftp).

or

Alternative 4: Create a web slide show manually

See documentation/skeleton for an example of the directory layout and 
basic files needed to create a web slide show.

If you wonder what the .json files in the sub-directory "skeleton/slides"
are good for, have a look at "documentation/GWTPhotoAlbum_docs/javadocs/
de/eckhartarnold/client/ImageCollectionReader.html"





E. Compiling the C++ replacement (or what there exists of it so far) for 
   GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py 


1. Download the sources from svn:

   svn checkout http://gwtphotoalbum.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gwtphotoalbum-read-only
   
   
2. Change to the albumcreator subdirectory and run:
   
   qmake
   make
   

3. Run albumcreator/quickalbum/quickalbum to create photoalbums. Or
   install the kipi-plugin by running "make install" in the 
   "albumcreator/kipiplugin_webslideshow" subdirectory. 




F. Changing the GWTPhotoAlbum AJAX code:


1. Change the code as you like (Apache 2.0 license :-) ). 
   I recommend using a powerful integrated development
   environment like eclipse.


2. Compile the code by simply running this command from the
   main directory:
  
   ant
    

3. In the "scripts" sub-directory re-run the "genDeploymentPackage.py" 
   script to update the AJAX code that is deployed by 
   "GWTPhotoAlbumCreator.py". Just type:
   
   python genDeploymentPackage.py
